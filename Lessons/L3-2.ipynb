    "The Python math module defines numerous useful mathematical functions. This library is an excellent example of the power of functions: commonly-used mathematical operations are packaged up in functions that can be re-used over and over. We don't have to define these functions or know how they work, we can simply call the functions and use the return value(s). Examples of math functions available for our use include:\n",
    "* `fabs()` for absolute values\n",
    "* `ceil()` for computing the ceiling of a number\n",
    "* `floor()` for computing the floor of a number\n",
    "* `cos()` for cosine function\n",
    "* `sin()` for sine function\n",
    "* `tan()` for tangent function\n",
    "* `pow()` for raising a number to its power\n",
    "* `log()` for logarithms (see also `log2()` and `log10()`\n",
    "* `sqrt()` for computing square roots\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: trig functions expect arguments in radians, not degrees. To convert degrees to radians, multiply by (`math.pi` / 180) or use the `radians()` function in the `math` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find out all the functions available within a module by importing the module, typing the module name and a dot, then pressing tab. This \"auto-complete\" feature is super helpful when learning a new library or when you can't remember the name of a function."
