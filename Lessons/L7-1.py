# # L7-1 Exam #1 Review

# ## What to Bring?
# * Two sharp pencils
# * Python Programming knowledge in your head :)
# * A "cheat sheet" (see below)  
# 
# ## What NOT to Bring?
# * Electronics (including calculators) may not be used during the exam!
# * Notes may not be used during the exam!
# 
# Note: If you are caught cheating, your exam will be confiscated and you will receive a 0.
# 
# Note: Use the restroom before class. **Once testing starts, the only reason for leaving the classroom is turning in your exam as done.**
# 
# ## The "Cheat Sheet"
# The exam will be closed-book, but you will be allowed a **handwritten** "cheat sheet": one side of a page whose dimensions may not exceed 8-1/2" by 5-1/2" (i.e. **one-half of a standard sheet of notebook paper**). You must present your cheat sheet to myself or a TA so it can be verified that it meets regulations. 
# 
# If you bring/use a cheat sheet that: 
# 1. Exceeds the allowable dimensions
# 1. Has writing on both sides of the page
# 1. Contains non-handwritten text (i.e. printed)
# 
# You run the risk of its being confiscated prior to the exam. This policy will be strictly enforced.
# 
# If you choose to use a cheat sheet, you will be required to turn in your cheat sheet with your exam.
# 
# ## Exam Timeframe
# Please be aware that, because you will be taking the exam during a normal lecture period (50 minutes), time will be extremely tight for the exam so manage your time well. If you show up late to class, you will have less time to take the exam. 

# ## Exam Coverage
# The exam covers everything we have covered so far in the course. Here is an outline of the topics we have covered so far:
# 
# ### 1 Introduction to Computer Science, Programming, and Python
# (Chapter 1 *The Way of the Program* in the Downey textbook.)

#     * Conditional statements
#     * Iterative statements
# * Construct multiple alternative `if` statements in Python
# * Construct nested `if` statements
# * How is false defined in Python? How about true?
#     * `bool` type
# * Define what is a predicate function

# ### Other Topics
# (Section 4.1 *The `turtle` Module* in the Downey Textbook)
# * Turtle graphics

# ## Recommended Strategy for Preparing for the Exam
# The exam questions will require you to solve problems in a variety of formats: defining key terms, evaluating expressions, writing code, determining the output of code, etc.
# 
# I recommend that you use the following activities and materials to prepare for the exam:
# * Review quizzes, lab exercises, programming assignments, and problems solved in class
#     * These may well be your best resource. An excellent learning activity would be to retake the quizzes and re-solve the lab exercises, in class exercises, and programming assignments. 
# * Lesson notes and example code
# * Read the textbook
#     * Read or re-read chapters 1-3, 5 (no recursion), 6, and Appendix A and in the Downey textbook. 

# ## Extra Practice Problems

# ### 1
# What is the output of the following code?

# In[ ]:

y = 55.9
x = 1 // 3
print("The value %.2f is in the variable x\n" %(x))
x = 4
print("The value %.1f is in the variable x\n" %(x))
print("The value %d is in the variable y\n" %(y))


# ### 2
# What is the output of the following code?

# In[ ]:

x = 0
y = 0
if x < 5:
    print("a")
    if y < x:
        print("bc")
    elif x > 5:
        print("def")
    else:
        print("ghijk")
else:
    print("lmnop")


# ### 3
# Define and call a function that accepts 3 numbers. The function computes and returns the average of the three numbers.

# ### 4
# What is the output of the following code?

# In[ ]:

def my_function(param1, param2):
    num1 = 5
    param2 = 2 + num1
    print("%d %d" %(num1, param2))
    param1 = num1 * param2
    return param1

def main():
    num1 = 3
    num2 = 2
    ret_val = my_function(num2, num1)
    print("%d %d %d" %(num1, num2, ret_val))

main()


# ### 5
# Evaluate the expressions below. To check your work, run the program to see the output.

# In[ ]:

print(5 // 3 * 2 / (4 % 3) + 5)
print(6.0 * 7 * 2 / 4 + 5 * 11)
print(6 % 4 + 9.0 / 4 + 2 * 5)
print(22 / 44 + (3 % 31))
print(15.0 - 4 // 6 + 2.0 * 1 - (14 % 6))
print(5 % 9 == 5 or (6 * 3 // 4 > 4 and 20 / 6 != 3))
print(4 > 3 and 2 == 2 and 3 > 9 and 34532 // 324 > 293)


# ### 6
# Complement the following statements by applying DeMorgan's Law. Reduce the expressions to the simplest terms possible:
# 1. `not (x and not y) or (x and y > 0)`
# 1. `a or not (b and not (x < y) or a == 0)`
# 1. `(a and b != c and not c) or (not a and not b and c == a)`
# 1. `x < 15 and y >= 1 and (y or x)`
# 1. `(a or not b or not c) and (a > c or not c)`

# ### 7
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a distance in kilometers. As part of your program, write and call the following functions:
# 1. A function to get a distance in kilometers from the user.
# 1. A function that converts a distance in kilometers to a distance in meters. The relationship between kilometers and meters is: 1 kilometer = 1000 meters
# 1. A function to display the resulting meters.

# ### 8
# Define and call a function called `volume_pyramid()` that accepts two floating-point input parameters, which represent the base (B) and height (h) of the square pyramid. The function returns the volume (V) of the pyramid defined by the two parameters. Recall: $V = 1/3 \times (B \times h)$

# ### 9
# Define and call a function `sum_multiples_of_3_7()` that returns the sum of the integers that are multiples of 3 AND 7. The function should accept three integer values as parameters. 
# 
# For example, your function should return 63 if 7, 21, and 42 are passed into it or 0 if 8, 3, and -7 are passed into it, etc.

# ### 10
# Write a program that determines the total discount, in dollars, for a customer based on age and student/employment status. The program prompts the user for a ticket price (a floating-point) and age (an integer) and sends these values as input parameters to a function called `compute_discount_amount()`. `compute_discount_amount()` does the following to determine the discount:
# 
# 1. Prompts the user for student status of customer. The user should enter "y" if they are currently a student; "n" otherwise.
# 1. Prompts the user for employment status of customer. The user should type "y" if they are a WSU employee; "n" otherwise. Note: a customer may be a student and an employee. 
# 1. The following discounts should be applied: 10% for employees, 12% for senior citizens, 15% for students, and 20% for students who are also employees. Note: a customer is considered a senior citizen if they are 65 years or older. 
# 1. The function returns the value of the ticket price times the discount percentage.

# ### 11
# Given the following `main()` function, write the `evenly_divisible()` function. 
# 
# The `evenly_divisible()` function returns `True` if the first parameter is evenly divisible by the second, or vice versa and `False` otherwise. (Note: What about if the user enters a 0?)

# In[ ]:

def main():
    print("Please enter the first integer: ")
    num1 = int(input())
    print("Please enter the second integer: ")
    num2 = int(input())
    if evenly_divisible(num1, num2):
        print("The two integers are evenly divisible")
    else:
        print("The two integers are not evenly divisible")


# ### 12
# Fix all syntax, logic, and runtime errors found in the following Python code. Be sure to look for omitted keywords, values, and punctuation.

# In[ ]:

Def main(value)
    character = "A",
    
    print("Enter a character: )
    character == input()
    retun character


# ### 13
# What will be printed by the code below?

# In[ ]:

x = 0.0
y = 3.0

if y < 5.0:
    if y >= 0.0:
        print("In the second if statement")
        x = 2 * y
    else:
        print("In the innermost else statement")
        x = -3 * y
        print("I love programming!")
else:
    x = 0 * y
x = x + 1
print("The value of x is %f" %(x))


# ### 14
# Convert this nested if statement to a single if statement with a compound condition:

# In[ ]:

if age >= 35:
    if born_in_us == 1:
        if us_resident >= 14:
            print("Congrats! You can run for president.")


# ### 15
# Write a multiple-alternative if statement to represent the following table (display the stage in life):
# 
# |Age (in years)|Stage in life|
# |-|-|
# |Less than 13|Kid|
# |13 - 19|Teenager|
# |20 - 54|Adult|
# |55 and above|Senior citizen|

# ### 16 
# Correct the syntax errors in the code below:

# In[ ]:

If x > 1.0
z = x
else
    z = y


# ### 17
# Based on the code below, specify values for `x` and `y` that will cause the strings below to print (EXAMPLE: x > 0 and x < 100, y > 10). If it is not possible to print a string, explain why.
