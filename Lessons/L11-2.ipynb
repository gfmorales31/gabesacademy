    "The exam will be closed-book, but you will be allowed a **handwritten** \"cheat sheet\": one side of a page whose dimensions may not exceed 8-1/2\" by 5-1/2\" (i.e. **one-half of a standard sheet of notebook paper**). You must present your cheat sheet to myself or a TA so it can be verified that it meets regulations. \n",
