# # L4-2 More Functions
# 
# Learner objectives for this lesson
# * Understand why functions are useful to use when designing programs and solving problems
# * Understand the execution flow of a program 
# * Recognize the scope of a name (identifier)

# ## Why Use Functions?
# * Break a large, complex solution into logical units
#     * Individual members of a programming team can work on each unit independently
# * Procedural abstraction 
#     * The calling function need not be aware of the details of how a function worksâ€”just what it does
#     * Thus, during high-level problem solving activities, we won't get bogged down in detail
# * Reuse
#     * Recall our comment on the original version of the program to compute and display the gpa of classes
#         * Redundant: Much code was duplicated
#     * Why re-write sections of code that have already been written and tested?
#     * Functions allow us to package up a well-designed solution into a **bite-size chunk that can be reused over and over**
#         * Name a group of statements for easier reading and debugging
# * Testing
#     * Allows for more efficient testing and bug resolution
#     * Each function is tested as it is implemented
# 
# ## How Functions are Executed
# * When a function is called, memory for local variables is allocated
# * Memory is released upon completion of function execution (local function variables do not "outlive" function)
# 
# Example: Recall the function `display_gpa()`:

# In[5]:

def display_gpa(gpa):
    '''
    Displays the final gpa to the user.
    '''
    print("Your GPA is: %.2f" %(gpa))


# In a function call such as `display_gpa(3.4)`, the value 3.4 is considered the argument of the function. When the function is executed, the value 3.4 is *copied* into a **new local variable**, `gpa`. We call `gpa` a local variable because the variable is only accessible within `display_gpa()` on this particular functional call (`display_gpa(3.4)`).
# 
# ## Scope
# **Scope of a name**: region of a program where a particular meaning of a name is viible or can be referenced.
# 
# ### Global Variables
# Variables declared outside of a function are considered *global*. In general, global variables are a [bad idea](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad) and we try to avoid using them.
# 
# ### Local Variables
# Parameter variables and variables declared within a function are considered *local*. Local variables are only visible from within that function; once function is done, variables go away (space is deallocated). Consider the following example:

# In[3]:

max_val = 950

def one(anarg, second):
    '''
    
    '''
    one_local = 0

def fun_two(one, anarg):
    '''
    
    '''
    local_var = 0
    
def main():
    '''
    
    '''
    local_var = 0
    
one(0, 1)
fun_two(5, 10)
main()
limit = 200


# When each of the above functions is executed, what is the scope of the following identifiers?
# 
# |Name|visible in `one()`|visible in `fun_two()`|visible in `main()`|
# |----|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
# |`max_val`|y|y|y|
# |`limit`|n|n|n|
# |`main`|y|y|y|
# |`local_var` (local variable in `main()`)|n|n|y|
# |`one` (function)|y|n|y|
# |`anarg` (parameter in `one()`)|y|n|n|
# |`second`|y|n|n|
# |`one_local`|y|n|n|
# |`fun_two`|y|y|y|
# |`one` (parameter in `fun_two()`)|n|y|n|
# |`anarg` (parameter in `fun_two()`)|n|y|n|
# |`local_var` (local variable in `fun_two()`)|n|y|n|

# ## Body-less Functions
# You can define a function without adding a body by simply placing the reserved keyword `pass` in the body. This can be useful when you want to test your program one function at a time or when you want to organize your program without actually writing the functions (or as a placeholder if someone else is writing the function). Example:

# In[7]:

def quadratic_root_finder(a, b, c):
    '''
    Applies the quadratic equation to find the roots of a quadratic function specified by the formula ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    
    To efficiently be implemented by someone else!
    '''
    pass


# ## Function Testing
# Each function is itself a small-scale "program" 
# * It has inputs
# * It has expected outputs or side-effects
# * Ideally, it is a self-contained "black box" (does not manipulate global variables)
# It makes sense to test each function independently
# * Correctness can be verified before it is used in a larger scale application
# A *test-driver* is a short program that tests a specific function
# 

# ## TODO
# 1. Read chapter 3 in the textbook.
# 1. Work on PA2
# 
# ## Next Lesson
# Debugging programs and function practice!
