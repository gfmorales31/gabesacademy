    "\n",
    "### Learner Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Solve problems using loops, file I/O, and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Implement `while` and `for` loops\n",
    "* Open, process, and close input and output files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review Lab Format\n",
    "For this review lab, solve/demo tasks from this lab (Lab 10) and tasks you have not previously solved from Labs 1-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Pair Task\n",
    "Your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
    "* Help your peers\n",
    "* Work on additional tasks\n",
    "* Work on the current programming assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Take advantage of your TA and your peers as resources and make the most of lab time!"

The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name where \"a\" is 1, \"b\" is 2, \"c\" is 3 etc., up to \"z\" being 26. For example, the name \"Zelle\" would have the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a very auspicious number, by the way).
