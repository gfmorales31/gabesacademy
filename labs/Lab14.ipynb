    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Solve problems using lists, tuples, dictionaries, and user-defined types (classes/objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Declare and work with lists\n",
    "* Declare and work with tuples\n",
    "* Declare and work with dictionaries\n",
    "* Define classes\n",
    "* Declare and work with objects\n",

    "### Review Lab Format\n",
    "For this review lab, solve/demo tasks from this lab (Lab 14) and tasks you have not previously solved from Labs 1-13.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Pair Task\n",
    "Your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",

    "* Work on additional tasks\n",
    "* Work on the current programming assignment\n",

As part of your solution, write a function called `most_common_letter()` that accepts a string argument, `text`, and returns a tuple containing the most commonly occurring letter and number of instances of the letter in `text`. For example, `most_common_letter(\"summer\")` would return `(\"m\", 2)`. `most_common_letter()` should use a dictionary to find the most commonly occurring letter.\n",
